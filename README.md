# Machine-learning-Credit-Risk-Prediction
This project is to evaluate the risk of Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) applications by developing a machine learning predictive model and a decision support system (DSS).  <br>
Tool: Python
* cleaned data, dealt with missing values and categorical values and conducted feature scaling to standardized numeric variables  <br>
* built machine learning models (logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting classifier,LDA,KNN), tuned hyper-parameter tuning and implemented 
cross validation to evaluate model performance.  <br>
Outcome: random forest performed best, achieving 73% accuracy
