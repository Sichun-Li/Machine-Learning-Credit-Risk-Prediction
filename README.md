# Machine-learning-Credit-Risk-Prediction
This project is to evaluate the risk of Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) applications by developing a machine learning predictive model and a decision support system (DSS).  <br>
What does HELOC mean?  <br>
A home equity line of credit, or HELOC, is a loan in which the lender agrees to lend a maximum amount within an agreed period (called a term), where the collateral is the borrower's equity in their house (akin to a second mortgage). Because a home often is a consumer's most valuable asset, many homeowners use home equity credit lines only for major items, such as education, home improvements, or medical bills, and choose not to use them for day-to-day expenses. HELOC abuse is often cited as one cause of the subprime mortgage crisis.  <br>

Tool: Python

* cleaned data, dealt with missing values and categorical values and conducted feature scaling to standardized numeric variables  <br>
* built machine learning models (logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting classifier,LDA,KNN), tuned hyper-parameter tuning and implemented 
cross validation to evaluate model performance.  <br>

Outcome: random forest performed best, achieving 73% accuracy
